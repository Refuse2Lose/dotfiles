== Install Grub ==

When reinstalling windows, this will get rid of the grub 
  bootloader and fail to recognize linux.  To circumvent
  this issue, we need to open up linux live distro and
  type in the following commands:
  
  cfdisk  //to see which sda# linux is installed on
  
  su      //most likely you will have to be root to do this
  mount -t ext4 /dev/sda# /mnt
  arch-chroot /mnt
  grub-install /dev/sda    //no number after sda
  
You might run into an error about Sector 32.  Just ignore it.
  That sector is no longer in use by grub.
  
  
That should be it!
