= Install Ruby =

To install ruby, we need to install RVM package manager:

  :$ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
  :$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

Then, at the terminal:

  :$ rvm install 2.4.0  # or what ever version number you would like to install
  
To mark a ruby version as the default version:

  :$ rvm use 2.4.0 --default
  

= Install Rails =

Make sure that gems are current:

  :$ rvm rubygems current
  
Then finally install rails

  :$ gem install rails
