= Functions =

Basic format of a bash function:

: function foo {
:   echo "bar"
: }

To get arguments to a function, use a "$":

: function getnum {
:   echo "Your number was $1! "
: }

Note: in the above example, make sure to leave a space
after the $1! or bash will think there was no closing
quotes..
