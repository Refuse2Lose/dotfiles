== Remote_Desktop_Setup  ==

Requirements:
 - On Ubuntu
   - Install and set up noip2 (ddns client)
   - Install and set up OpenSSH with apt-get
   - Install x11vnc with apt-get
 - On Windows
   - Install Putty for ssh
   - Install RealVnc Viewer


There is already a script in dotfiles/bin:
  "noip2_start.sh"
that needs to be started with Ubuntu.  To do this,
search for 'startup programs' in the ubuntu search
bar and create a new startup script through the
gui to point to this bash script.  This will keep
the ddns client running at all times.

On the router, there needs to be port forwarding set up:
 - For SSH:
   - port: 5801
 - For noip2:
   - port: 8245
 - For VNC:
   - port: 5900 - 5905

To Use:
 - Run putty and connect to '<host name>:5801'
 - At the terminal:
     :$ x11vnc
 - On windows, run vnc viewer and connect to '<host name>'
 - It should automatically connect
